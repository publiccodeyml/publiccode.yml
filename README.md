  <i>
    A metadata description standard for public software that is easy to use both for
    developers and people with less technical background in order to make the

## What this file is for

Many great software projects are developed by public administrations, however
reuse of these projects is very limited. Some of the reasons for low uptake of
such projects is a lack of discoverability and that it is hard to find out what
project can actually work in the context of a different public administration.

The `publiccode.yml` file is meant to solve all those problems. It is
an easily readable file for civil servants that are trying to figure out
whether a project will work for them, and easily readable by computers as
well. It contains information such as:
* the title and description of the project in English and/or other
  languages;
* the development status, e.g. `concept`, `development`, `beta`, `stable`,
  `obsolete`;
* which organisation developed the project;
* who is caring for the maintenance and when this expires;
* who to contact for technical or support inquiries;
* what national and local legal frameworks the project is designed
  for;
* what software dependencies the project has.

The `publiccode.yml` file format should both be able to easily be added to any
new project, as well as grow with the project as it expands beyond the original
context it was developed in.

## Finding projects

Finding projects depends on how the search API is structured for every hosting
platform. For example, you can find all `publiccode.yml` on GitHub files by
searching using the frontend or the API.

* [GitHub Search `path:publiccode.yml`](https://github.com/search?q=path%3Apubliccode.yml&type=code)

The Italian Digital Transformation Team is also working on providing a scanner
which looks for all publiccode files on all publicly accessible websites, and
exposing them as open data.
