# publiccode.yml Working Group Charter

The publiccode.yml Working Group is a community of people with the common goal of evolving and
maintaining the publiccode.yml Standard.

We welcome contributions by everyone, in the form of Pull Requests.

To ensure the development of the project is always aligned to the needs of public agencies, we set
up a [Steering Committee](#steering-commitee) composed solely of public servants.  The Committee is
tasked with the formal voting required to evolve the core Standard.

All other tools are community-maintained.
