# Contributing to this Standard

Thank you for your interest in contributing! ðŸ™‡

We â€“ the maintainers and contributors of this project â€“ understand that a Standard
like this can only be set in collaboration with as many public technologists,
policymakers and interested folks as possible. Thus, we appreciate your input, enjoy
feedback and welcome improvements to this project and are very open to collaboration.

We love issues and pull requests from everyone.

## I want to help develop the standard

Please help development by reporting problems, suggesting changes and asking questions.
You don't need to change any of our code or documentation to be a contributor!

Anyone is welcome to participate!

The best ways to do so are:
* [Participate in discussions](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/discussions)
* Once you know your contribution is ready, [open a pull request](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/pulls)

## I am a Free Software developer

Help us bring new Free Software into governments!
You can add a `publiccode.yml` file in your repositories, ask other projects to do it,
or, even better, help us create tools.

Don't be afraid to start new ones and
[show them to the community](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/discussions/categories/show-and-tell).

## I am a public software vendor

Add a `publiccode.yml` file to your repositories!
After that, you can submit it to national catalogs, for example:

* [Developers Italia](https://github.com/italia/developers-italia-backend)
* ...

## I am a public servant and want to represent my country in the Steering Committee

We are happy to have you here!

[Take a look at the Charter](/governance/charter.md) and, once you made sure you are
the right person, please [create a new post](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/discussions/categories/general).

The Chair will get in touch with you and get you started.

We strongly encourage you to also contribute translations (if applicable) and, if needed,
[a national section](https://yml.publiccode.tools/country.html).
Just make your changes and [submit a Pull Request](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/pulls).

# In short

If you never used GitHub, get up to speed with [understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
or follow one of the great free interactive courses in the
[GitHub learning lab](https://lab.github.com/).

This project is [CC-0 licensed](LICENSE), which essentially means that the project, along
with your contributions, is in the Public Domain in whatever jurisdiction possible, and
everyone can do whatever they want with it.

### 1. Make your changes

This project uses the [**GitHub flow branching model**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).

Add your changes in commits [with a message that explains them](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message).
Document choices or decisions you make in the commit message, this will enable everyone to
be informed of your choices in the future.

### 2. Pull Request

When submitting the pull request, please accompany it with a description of the problem
you are trying to address and the reference to the relevant Issue or Discussion.

If your Pull Request is about a part of the Standard or the Governance of the project,
it's considered as a formal proposal and will be voted on,
[following this procedure](/governance/procedure-proposing-changes-and-voting.md).

### 3. Improve

All contributions have to be reviewed by someone.

It could be that your contribution can be merged immediately by a maintainer.
However, usually, a new Pull Request needs some improvements before it can be merged.

Other contributors (or helper robots) might have feedback.
If this is the case, the reviewing maintainer will help you improve the Pull Request.

If your documentation or code have passed human review, it is merged.

### 4. Celebrate

Your ideas, documentation and code have become an integral part of this project.
You are the Open Source hero we need!

In fact, feel free to open a Pull Request to add your name to the [`AUTHORS`](AUTHORS.md)
file and get eternal attribution.
