# Contributing to this standard

🙇‍♀️ Thank you for contributing!

We – the maintainers and contributors of this project – understand that a standard like this can only be set in collaboration with as many public technologists, policy makers and interested folk as possible. Thus we appreciate your input, enjoy feedback and welcome improvements to this project and are very open to collaboration.

We love issues and pull requests from everyone.

## Problems, suggestions and questions in Issues

Please help development by reporting problems, suggesting changes and asking questions. To do this, you can [create a GitHub Issue](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/) for this project in the [GitHub Issues for publiccode.yml](https://github.com/italia/publiccode.yml/issues).

You don't need to change any of our code or documentation to be a contributor!

## Documentation and code in Pull Requests

If you want to add to the documentation or code of one of our projects you should make a Pull Request. 

If you never used GitHub, get up to speed with [Understanding the GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) or follow one of the great free interactive courses in the [GitHub learning lab](https://lab.github.com/) on working with GitHub and working with MarkDown, the syntax this project's documentation is in.

This project is [licenced CC-0](LICENSE), which essentially means that the project, along with your contributions is in the Public Domain in whatever jusrisdiction possible, and everyone can do whatever they want with it.

### 1. Make your changes

This project uses the [**GitFlow branching model** and workflow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). When you've forked this repository, please make sure to create a feature branch following the GitFlow model.

Add your changes in commits [with a message that explains them](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message). Document choices or decisions you make in the commit message, this will enable everyone to be informed of your choices in the future.

If you are adding code, make sure you've added and updated the relevant documentation and tests before you submit your pull request. Make sure to write tests that show the behaviour of the newly added or changed code.

### 2. Pull Request

When submitting the pull request, please accompany it with a description of the problem you are trying to address and the issue numbers that this Pull Request fixes/addresses.

### 3. Improve

All contributions have to be reviewed by someone.

It could be that your contribution can be merged immediately by a maintainer. However, usually, a new Pull Request needs some improvements before it can be merged. Other contributors (or helper robots) might have feedback. If this is the case the reviewing maintainer will help you improve your documentation and code.

If your documentation and code have passed human review, it is merged.

### 4. Celebrate

Your ideas, documentation and code have become an integral part of this project. You are the Open Source hero we need! 

In fact, feel free to open a PR to add your name to the [`AUTHORS`](AUTHORS.md) file and get eternal attribution.
