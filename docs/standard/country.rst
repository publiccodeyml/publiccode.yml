Country-specific sections
=========================

Country-specific sections allow including information relevant only within a
given country, such as compliance with national regulations or integration with
national platforms.

Each section is identified by a two-letter ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code
lowercase (*deprecated*) or uppercase `ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country
codes <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2>`__.

Currently, the only defined country-specific section is the Italian one (``it:``).
