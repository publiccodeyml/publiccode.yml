The Standard (core)
===================

This document represents the description of the ``publiccode.yml``
schema.

Top-Level Keys and Sections
---------------------------

Key ``publiccodeYmlVersion``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: string
-  Presence: mandatory
-  Example: ``"0.1"``

This key specifies the version to which the current ``publiccode.yml``
adheres to, for forward compatibility.

Key ``name``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: string
-  Presence: mandatory
-  Example: ``"Medusa"``

This key contains the name of the software. It contains the (short)
public name of the product, which can be localised in the specific
``localisation`` section. It should be the name most people usually
refer to the software. In case the software has both an internal “code”
name and a commercial name, use the commercial name.

Key ``applicationSuite``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: string
-  Presence: optional
-  Example: ``"MegaProductivitySuite"``

This key contains the name of the “suite” to which the software belongs.

Key ``url``
~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: string (URL)
-  Presence: mandatory
-  Example: ``"https://example.com/italia/medusa.git"``

A unique identifier for this software. This string must be a URL to the
source code repository (git, svn, …) in which the software is published.
If the repository is available under multiple protocols, prefer
HTTP/HTTPS URLs which don’t require user authentication.

Forks created for the purpose of contributing upstream should not
modify this file; this helps software parsing ``publiccode.yml`` to
immediately skip technical forks. On the contrary, a
complete fork that is meant to be maintained separately from the
original software should modify this line, to give themselves the status
of a different project.

See :ref:`forks-and-variants` for a complete description of what
is a software variant and how to handle forked softwares as a parser or
an author.

Key ``landingURL``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: string (URL)
-  Presence: optional
-  Example: ``"https://example.com/italia/medusa"``

If the ``url`` parameter does not serve a human readable or browsable
page, but only serves source code to a source control client, with this
key you have an option to specify a landing page. This page, ideally, is
where your users will land when they will click a button labeled
something like “Go to the application source code”. In case the product
provides an automated graphical installer, this URL can point to a page
which contains a reference to the source code but also offers the
download of such an installer.

Key ``isBasedOn``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: string or array of strings
-  Presence: optional
-  Example: ``"https://github.com/italia/otello.git"``

In case this software is a variant or a fork of another software, which
might or might not contain a ``publiccode.yml`` file, this key will
contain the ``url`` of the original project(s).

The existence of this key identifies the fork as a software
variant, descending from the specified repositories.

Key ``softwareVersion``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: string
-  Presence: optional
-  Example: ``"1.0"``, ``"dev"``

This key contains the latest stable version number of the software. The
version number is a string that is not meant to be interpreted and
parsed but just displayed; parsers should not assume semantic versioning
or any other specific version format.

The key can be omitted if the software is currently in initial
development and has never been released yet.

Key ``releaseDate``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: string (date)
-  Presence: mandatory
-  Example: ``"2017-04-15"``

This key contains the date at which the latest version was released.
This date is mandatory if the software has been released at least once
and thus the version number is present.

Key ``logo``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: string (relative path to file or absolute URL)
-  Presence: optional
-  Acceptable formats: SVG, SVGZ, PNG
-  Example: ``"img/logo.svg"``

This key contains the path to the logo of the software. Logos should be
in vector format; raster formats are only allowed as a fallback. In this
case, they should be transparent PNGs, minimum 1000px of width.
The key value can be the relative path to the file starting from the root of
the repository, or it can be an absolute URL pointing to the logo in raw
version. In both cases, the file must reside inside the same repository where
the ``publiccode.yml`` file is stored.

Key ``monochromeLogo``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: string (path to file)
-  Presence: optional
-  Acceptable formats: SVG, SVGZ, PNG
-  Example: ``"img/logo-mono.svg"``

A monochromatic (black) logo. The logo should be in vector format;
raster formats are only allowed as a fallback. In this case, they should
be transparent PNGs, minimum 1000px of width.
The key value can be the relative path to the file starting from the root of
the repository, or it can be an absolute URL pointing to the logo in raw
version. In both cases, the file must reside inside the same repository where
the ``publiccode.yml`` file is stored.

Key ``inputTypes``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: array of enumerated strings
-  Presence: optional
-  Values: as per RFC 6838
-  Example: ``"text/plain"``

A list of Media Types (MIME Types) as mandated in `RFC
6838 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838>`__ which the application can
handle as output.

In case the software does not support any input, you can skip this field
or use ``application/x.empty``.

Key ``outputTypes``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: array of enumerated strings
-  Presence: optional
-  Values: as per RFC 6838
-  Example: ``"text/plain"``

A list of Media Types (MIME Types) as mandated in `RFC
6838 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6838>`__ which the application can
handle as output.

In case the software does not support any output, you can skip this
field or use ``application/x.empty``.

Key ``platforms``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: enumerated string or array of strings
-  Presence: mandatory
-  Values: ``web``, ``windows``, ``mac``, ``linux``, ``ios``,
   ``android``. Human readable values outside this list are allowed.
-  Example: ``web``

This key specifies which platform the software runs on. It is meant to
describe the platforms that users will use to access and operate the
software, rather than the platform the software itself runs on.

Use the predefined values if possible. If the software runs on a
platform for which a predefined value is not available, a different
value can be used.

Key ``categories``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: array of strings
-  Presence: mandatory
-  Acceptable values: see :ref:`categories-list` 

A list of words that can be used to describe the software and can help
building catalogs of open software.

The controlled vocabulary :ref:`categories-list` contains the list of allowed
values.

Key ``usedBy``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: array of strings
-  Presence: optional

A list of the names of prominent public administrations (that will serve
as “testimonials”) that are currently known to the software maintainer
to be using this software.

Parsers are encouraged to enhance this list also with other information
that can obtain independently; for instance, a fork of a software, owned
by an administration, could be used as a signal of usage of the
software.

Key ``roadmap``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: string
-  Presence: optional

A link to a public roadmap of the software.

Key ``developmentStatus``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Type: enumerated string
-  Presence: mandatory
-  Allowed values: ``concept``, ``development``, ``beta``, ``stable``,
   ``obsolete``

The keys are: 

-  ``concept`` - The software is just a “concept”. No
   actual code may have been produced, and the repository could simply be a
   placeholder. 
-  ``development`` - Some effort has gone into the
   development of the software, but the code is not ready for the end user,
   even in a preliminary version (beta or alpha) to be tested by end users.
-  ``beta`` - The software is in the testing phase (alpha or beta). At
   this stage, the software might or might not have had a preliminary
   public release. 
-  ``stable`` - The software has seen a first public
   release and is ready to be used in a production environment.
-  ``obsolete`` - The software is no longer maintained or kept up to date.
   All of the source code is archived and kept for historical reasons.

Key ``softwareType``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   ``"standalone/desktop"``, ``"standalone/web"``, ``"standalone/backend"``,
   ``"standalone/other"``, ``"addon"``, ``"library"``, ``"configurationFiles"``

The keys are:

-  ``standalone/mobile`` - The software is a standalone, self-contained
   The software is a native mobile app.
-  ``standalone/iot`` - The software is suitable for an IoT context.
-  ``standalone/desktop`` - The software is typically installed and run in a  
   a desktop operating system environment.
-  ``standalone/web`` - The software represents a web application usable by
   means of a browser.

-  ``library`` - The software contains a library or an SDK to make it
   easier to third party developers to create new products.
-  ``configurationFiles`` - The software does not contain executable
   script but a set of configuration files. They may document how to
   obtain a certain deployment. They could be in the form of plain
   configuration files, bash scripts, ansible playbooks, Dockerfiles, or
   other instruction sets.

Section ``intendedAudience``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key ``intendedAudience/countries``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: array of strings
-  Presence: optional

This key explicitly includes certain countries in the intended audience,
i.e. the software explicitly claims compliance with specific processes,
technologies or laws. All countries are specified using lowercase ISO
3166-1 alpha-2 two-letter country codes.

Key ``intendedAudience/unsupportedCountries``
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: array of strings
-  Presence: optional

This key explicitly marks countries as NOT supported. This might be the
case if there is a conflict between how software is working and a
specific law, process or technology. All countries are specified using
lowercase ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 two-letter country codes.

Key ``intendedAudience/scope``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: array of strings
-  Presence: optional
-  Acceptable values: see :ref:`scope-list` 

This key contains a list of tags related to the field of application of
the software. 

Section ``description``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section contains a general description of the software. Parsers can
use this section for instance to create a web page describing the
software.

**Note:** since all the strings contained in this section are
user-visible and written in a specific language, you **must** specify
the language you are editing the text in (using the IETF 
`BCP 47 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47>`__ specifications) by
creating a sub-section with that name. The primary language subtag cannot be
omitted, as mandated by the BCP 47.  

An example for English:

.. code:: yaml 

   description:
     en:
       shortDescription: ...
       longDescription: ...

In the following part of the document, all keys are assumed to be in a
sub-section with the name of the language (we will note this with
``[lang]``).

**Note:** it is mandatory to have *at least* one language in this
section. All other languages are optional.

Key ``description/[lang]/localisedName``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: string
-  Presence: optional
-  Example: ``"Medusa"``

This key is an opportunity to localise the name in a specific language.
It contains the (short) public name of the product. It should be the
name most people usually refer to the software. In case the software has
both an internal “code” name and a commercial name, use the commercial
name.

Key ``description/[lang]/genericName``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: string (max 35 chars)
-  Presence: mandatory
-  Example: ``"Text Editor"``

This key is the “Generic name”, which refers to the specific category to
which the software belongs. You can usually find the generic name in the
presentation of the software, when you write: “Software xxx is a yyy”.
Notable examples include “Text Editor”, “Word Processor”, “Web Browser”,
“Chat” and so on… The generic name can be up to 35 characters long.

Key ``description/[lang]/shortDescription``
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: string (max 150 chars)
-  Presence: mandatory
-  Example: ``"Advanced booking system for hospitals"``

This key contains a short description of the software. It should be a
single line containing a single sentence. Maximum 150 characters are
allowed.

Key ``description/[lang]/longDescription``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: string (min 500 chars, max 10000 chars)
-  Presence: mandatory (for at least one language)

This key contains a longer description of the software, between 500 and
10000 chars. It is meant to provide an overview of the capabilities of
the software for a potential user. The audience for this text should be
that of users of the software, not developers. You can think of this
text as the description of the software that would be in its website (if
the software had one).

This description can contain some basic markdown: ``*italic*``,
``**bold**``, bullet points and ``[links](#)``.

Key ``description/[lang]/documentation``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: URL
-  Presence: optional

This key contains a reference to the user-level (not developer-level)
documentation of the software. The value must be a URL to a hosted
version of the documentation.

It is suggested that the URL points to a hosted version of the
documentation that is immediately readable through a common web browser
in both desktop and mobile format. The documentation should be rendered
in HTML and browsable like a website (with a navigation index, a search
bar, etc.).

If the documentation is instead available only as a document, put a
direct view/download link as URL in this key. You should commit the
document as part of the source code repository, and then link to it
using the code hosting source browser URL (e.g.: GitHub URL to the file).
Prefer using open formats like PDF or ODT for maximum interoperability.

Whichever the format for the documentation, remember to make its source
files available under an open license, possibly by committing them as
part of the repository itself.

Key ``description/[lang]/apiDocumentation``
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: URL
-  Presence: optional

This key contains a reference to the API documentation of the software.
The value must be a URL to a hosted version of the documentation.

It is suggested that the URL points to a hosted version of the
documentation that is immediately readable through a common web browser.
The documentation should be rendered in HTML and browsable like a
website (with a navigation index, a search bar, etc.), and if there is a
reference or test deployment, possibly offer an interactive interface
(e.g. Swagger).

If the documentation is instead available only as a document, put a
direct view/download link as URL in this key. You should commit the
document as part of the source code repository, and then link to it
using the code hosting source browser URL (e.g.: GitHub URL to the file).
Prefer using open formats like PDF or ODT for maximum interoperability.

Whichever the format for the documentation, remember to make its source
files available under an open license, possibly by committing them as
part of the repository itself.

Key ``description/[lang]/features``
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: array of strings
-  Presence: mandatory (for at least one language)

This key contains a list of software features, describing what
capabilities the software allows to do. The audience for this text
should be that of public decision makers who will be commissioning the
software. The features should thus not target developers: instead of
listing technical features referring to implementation details, prefer
listing user-visible functionalities of the software.

While the key is mandatory, there is no mandatory minimum or maximum
number of features that should be listed in this key. Each feature must
use a maximum of 100 characters.

The suggested number of features to list is between 5 and 20, depending
on the software size and complexity. There is no need for
exhaustiveness, as users can always read the documentation for
additional information.

Key ``description/[lang]/screenshots``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: array of strings (paths)
-  Presence: optional
-  Formats: PNG, JPG
-  Example: ``"data/screenshots/configuration.png"``

This key contains one or multiple paths to files showing screenshots of
the software. They are meant to give a quick idea on how the software
looks like and how it works.
The key value can be the relative path to the file starting from the root of
the repository, or it can be an absolute URL pointing to the screenshot in raw
version. In both cases, the file must reside inside the same repository where
the ``publiccode.yml`` file is stored.

Screenshots can be of any shape and size; the suggested formats are:

-  Desktop: 1280x800 @1x
-  Tablet: 1024x768 @2x
-  Mobile: 375x667 @2x

Key ``description/[lang]/videos``
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: array of strings (URLs)
-  Presence: optional
-  Example: ``"https://youtube.com/xxxxxxxx"``

This key contains one or multiple URLs of videos showing how the
software works. Like screenshots, videos should be used to give a quick
overview on how the software looks like and how it works. Videos must be
hosted on a video sharing website that supports the
`oEmbed <https://oembed.com>`__ standard; popular options are YouTube
and Vimeo.

Since videos are an integral part of the documentation, it is
recommended to publish them with an open license.

Key ``description/[lang]/awards``
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: array of strings
-  Presence: optional

A list of awards won by the software.

Section ``legal``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Key ``legal/license``
'''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: string
-  Presence: mandatory
-  Example: ``"AGPL-3.0-or-later"``

This string describes the license under which the software is
distributed. The string must contain a valid SPDX expression, referring
to one (or multiple) open-source license. Please refer to the `SPDX
documentation <https://spdx.org/licenses/>`__ for further information.

Key ``legal/mainCopyrightOwner``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: string
-  Presence: optional
-  Example: ``"City of Amsterdam"``

This string describes the entity that owns the copyright on “most” of
the code in the repository. Normally, this is the line that is reported
with the copyright symbol at the top of most files in the repo.

It is possible to list multiple owners if required so, using an English
sentence. It is also possible to informally refer to a community of
group of people like “Linus Torvalds and all Linux contributors”.

In case it is not possible to name a main copyright owner, it is
possible to omit this key; in those cases, if the repo has a authors
file, you can point to it through ``legal/authorsFile``.

Key ``legal/repoOwner``
'''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: string
-  Presence: optional
-  Example: ``"City of Amsterdam"``

This string describes the entity that owns this repository; this might
or might not be the same entity who owns the copyright on the code
itself. For instance, in case of a fork of the original software, the
``repoOwner`` is probably different from the ``mainCopyrightOwner``.

Key ``legal/authorsFile``
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: string (path to file)
-  Presence: optional
-  Example: ``"doc/AUTHORS.txt"``

Some open-source softwares adopt a convention of identify the copyright
holders through a file that lists all the entities that own the
copyright. This is common in projects strongly backed by a community
where there are many external contributors and no clear single/main
copyright owner. In such cases, this key can be used to refer to the
authors file, using a path relative to the root of the repository.

Section ``maintenance``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides information on the maintenance status of the
software, useful to evaluate whether the software is actively developed
or not.

Key ``maintenance/type``
''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: enumerate
-  Presence: mandatory
-  Values: ``"internal"``, ``"contract"``, ``"community"``, ``"none"``

This key describes how the software is currently maintained.

-  ``internal`` - means that the software is internally maintained by the
   repository owner. 
-  ``contract`` - means that there is a commercial
   contract that binds an entity to the maintenance of the software;
-  ``community`` - means that the software is currently maintained by one
   or more people that donate their time to the project; 
-  ``none`` - means that the software is not actively maintained.

Key ``maintenance/contractors``
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: array of Contractor (see below)
-  Presence: mandatory (if ``maintenance/type`` **is** ``contract``)

This key describes the entity or entities, if any, that are currently
contracted for maintaining the software. They can be companies,
organizations, or other collective names.

Key ``maintenance/contacts``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: List of Contacts (see below)
-  Presence: mandatory (if ``maintenance/type`` **is** ``internal`` or ``community``)

One or more contacts maintaining this software.

This key describes the technical people currently responsible for
maintaining the software. All contacts need to be a physical person, not
a company or an organisation. If somebody is acting as a representative
of an institution, it must be listed within the ``affiliation`` of the
contact.

In case of a commercial agreement (or a chain of such agreements),
specify the final entities actually contracted to deliver the
maintenance. Do not specify the software owner unless it is technically
involved with the maintenance of the product as well.

Section ``localisation``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides an overview of the localization features of the
software.

Key ``localisation/localisationReady``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: boolean
-  Presence: mandatory

If ``yes``, the software has infrastructure in place or is otherwise
designed to be multilingual. It does not need to be available in more
than one language.

Key ``localisation/availableLanguages``
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: list of IETF BCP 47 language tags
-  Presence: mandatory
-  Example: ``"it"``, ``"en"``, ``"sl-IT-nedis"``

If present, this is the list of languages in which the software is
available. Of course, this list will contain at least one language.
The primary language subtag cannot be omitted, as mandated by the 
`BCP 47 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47>`__.

Section ``dependsOn``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This section provides an overview on the system-level dependencies
required to install and use this software.

**NOTE:** do not list dependencies at the source code level (e.g.:
software libraries being used), and focus only on runtime and/or
system-level dependencies that must be installed and maintained
separately. For instance, a database is a good example of such
dependencies.

Key ``dependsOn/open``
''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: array of ``dependency`` (see below)
-  Presence: optional

This key contains a list of runtime dependencies that are distributed
under an open-source license.

Key ``dependsOn/proprietary``
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: array of ``dependency`` (see below)
-  Presence: optional

This key contains a list of runtime dependencies that are distributed
under a proprietary license.

Key ``dependsOn/hardware``
''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  Type: array of ``dependency`` (see below)
-  Presence: optional

This key contains a list of hardware dependencies that must be owned to
use the software.

Special data formats
--------------------

Dependency
~~~~~~~~~~

A ``dependency`` is a complex object. The properties are the following:

-  ``name`` - **mandatory** - The name of the dependency (e.g. MySQL,
   NFC Reader)
-  ``versionMin`` - the first compatible version
-  ``versionMax`` - the latest compatible version
-  ``version`` - the only major version for which the software is
   compatible. It assumes compatibility with all patches and bugfixes
   later applied to this version.
-  ``optional`` - whether the dependency is optional or mandatory

Complex versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is of course possible to use the various keys to specify a complex
compatibility matrix.

*Ex. 1*

.. code:: yaml

   - name: PostgreSQL
     version: "3.2"
     optional: yes

This snippet marks an optional dependency on PostgreSQL exactly version
3.2.

*Ex. 2*

.. code:: yaml

   - name: MySQL
     versionMin: "1.1"
     versionMax: "1.3"

This snippet marks a mandatory dependency on MySQL, allowing any version
between 1.1 and 1.3.

Contact
~~~~~~~

A Contact is an object with the following properties:

-  ``name`` - **mandatory** - This key contains the full name of one of
   the technical contacts. It must be a real person; do NOT populate
   this key with generic contact information, company departments,
   associations, etc.
-  ``email`` - This key contains the e-mail address of the technical
   contact. It must be an email address of where the technical contact
   can be directly reached; do NOT populate this key with mailing-lists
   or generic contact points like “info@acme.inc”. The e-mail address
   must not be obfuscated. To improve resistance against e-mail
   collection, use ``\x64`` to replace ``@``, as allowed by the YAML
   specification.
-  ``phone`` - phone number (with international prefix). This has to be
   a string. 
-  ``affiliation`` - This key contains an explicit affiliation
   information for the technical contact. In case of multiple
   maintainers, this can be used to create a relation between each
   technical contact and each maintainer entity. It can contain for
   instance a company name, an association name, etc.

Contractor
~~~~~~~~~~

A Contractor is an object with the following properties:

-  ``name`` - **mandatory** - The name of the contractor, whether it’s a
   company or a physical person.
-  ``until`` - **mandatory** - This is a date (YYYY-MM-DD). This key
   must contain the date at which the maintenance is going to end. In
   case of community maintenance, the value should not be more than 2
   years in the future, and thus will need to be regularly updated as
   the community continues working on the project.
-  ``email`` - This key contains the e-mail address of the technical
   contact. It must be an email address of where the technical contact
   can be directly reached; do NOT populate this key with mailing-lists
   or generic contact points like “info@acme.inc”. The e-mail address
   must not be obfuscated. To improve resistance against e-mail
   collection, use ``\x64`` to replace ``@``, as allowed by the YAML
   specification.
-  ``website`` - This key points to the maintainer website. It can
   either point to the main institutional website, or to a more
   project-specific page or website.

Dates
~~~~~

All dates in ``publiccode.yml`` must follow the format “YYYY-MM-DD”,
which is one of the ISO8601 allowed encoding. This is the only allowed
encoding though, so not the full ISO8601 is allowed for the date keys.
