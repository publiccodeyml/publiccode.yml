Country-Specific Sections
=========================

While the standard is structured to be meaningful on an international
level, there are additional information that can be added that makes
sense in specific countries, such as declaring compliance with local
laws or regulations. The provided extension mechanism is the usage of
country-specific sections.

All country-specific sections live under a key named after two-letter
lowercase `ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country
codes <https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2>`__. For instance
``spid`` is a property for Italian software declaring whether the
software is integrated with the Italian Public Identification System.

If a software is compliant I will find:

.. code:: yaml

   it:
     countryExtensionVersion: "1.0"
     piattaforme:
      - spid: yes

Notice that country-specific keys within international sections
are not allowed. Countries that want to extend the format should add a
country-specific section instead.
